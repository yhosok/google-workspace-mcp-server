```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Authentication Setup

This server supports two authentication methods:

### Option 1: Service Account Authentication (Server-to-Server)

**Best for:** Automated workflows, server environments, accessing organization-wide resources

#### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the required Google APIs:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API" and click "Enable"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API" and click "Enable"
   - Search for "Google Drive API" and click "Enable"
   - Search for "Google Docs API" and click "Enable"

#### 2. Create a Service Account

1. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Fill in the service account details
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip role assignment (or assign minimal required roles)
6. Click "Done"

#### 3. Generate Service Account Key

1. Find your service account in the credentials list
2. Click on the service account name
3. Go to the "Keys" tab
4. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
5. Choose "JSON" format
6. Download the key file and save it securely

#### 4. Share Google Workspace Resources

For the service account to access your Google Workspace resources:

**For Google Sheets:**
1. Open the Google Sheet you want to access
2. Click "Share"
3. Add the service account email (found in the JSON key file)
4. Grant appropriate permissions (Viewer/Editor)

**For Google Calendar:**
1. Open Google Calendar
2. In the left sidebar, find the calendar you want to share
3. Click the three dots next to the calendar name
4. Select "Settings and sharing"
5. In "Share with specific people", click "Add people"
6. Add the service account email (found in the JSON key file)
7. Grant appropriate permissions (See all event details/Make changes to events)

**For Google Docs:**
1. Open the Google Doc you want to access
2. Click "Share"
3. Add the service account email (found in the JSON key file)
4. Grant appropriate permissions (Viewer/Editor)

### Option 2: OAuth2 User Authentication (Interactive)

**Best for:** Personal use, development, accessing user's own resources

This option requires both client ID and client secret, with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) providing enhanced security. PKCE follows RFC 7636 standards to protect against authorization code interception attacks, working in addition to the standard client secret authentication.

#### 1. Create OAuth2 Credentials

1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Select "Desktop application" as the application type
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Google Workspace MCP Server")
5. Click "Create"
6. **Important**: Download the credentials JSON file and note both the Client ID and Client Secret - both are required for OAuth2 authentication

#### 2. Configure Redirect URI

1. Edit your OAuth2 client credentials
2. Add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to "Authorized redirect URIs"
3. Save the changes

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Set up your `.env` file with OAuth2 credentials (both client ID and client secret are required):
```env
GOOGLE_AUTH_MODE=oauth2
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback
GOOGLE_OAUTH_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
```

**Note**: Both `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are required. PKCE security is automatically enabled to provide additional protection beyond the client secret.

#### 4. First-Time Authentication

When you first run the server with OAuth2:
1. The server will automatically open your browser
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Grant the requested permissions
4. The server will receive the authorization and store refresh tokens securely
5. Future runs will use stored tokens automatically

#### 5. Token Security

- **Enhanced Security**: PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) provides additional protection against authorization code interception attacks
- **Secure Storage**: Tokens are stored securely using your OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, Secret Service on Linux)
- **Fallback Storage**: Encrypted file storage is used if keychain access is unavailable
- **Token Management**: Refresh tokens are automatically managed and never logged
- **Client Secret Protection**: Standard OAuth2 client secret authentication is required, with PKCE providing an additional security layer

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as template).

> **üõ°Ô∏è SECURE BY DEFAULT**: The server defaults to read-only mode (`GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`) for enhanced security. You must explicitly set `GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=false` to enable write operations. This secure-by-default configuration ensures maximum data protection.

### Service Account Configuration

For Service Account authentication:

```env
GOOGLE_AUTH_MODE=service-account
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json
```

### OAuth2 Configuration

For OAuth2 authentication (both client ID and client secret are required):

```env
GOOGLE_AUTH_MODE=oauth2
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback
GOOGLE_OAUTH_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
GOOGLE_OAUTH_PORT=3000
```

**Security Features**:
- Standard OAuth2 client secret authentication
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security
- Secure token storage with OS keychain integration

### Optional Folder Configuration

```env
# Optional folder placement for new spreadsheets
# If set, new spreadsheets will be created in this folder
# If not set, spreadsheets will be created in the default location (root)

# Tool-specific write permissions (comma-separated)
# Only allow specific write tools to execute
GOOGLE_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS=google-workspace__sheets-write,google-workspace__sheets-append

# Global read-only mode (SECURE BY DEFAULT)
# Must be explicitly set to false to enable write operations
GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=true  # Default: true (secure by default - read-only)
```

#### Access Control Modes

**Folder-based Restrictions:**
```env
# Restrict all file modifications to the specified folder
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your-folder-id
GOOGLE_ALLOW_WRITES_OUTSIDE_FOLDER=false
```

**Service-level Restrictions:**
```env

```env
# Default secure behavior - all write operations disabled
GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=true  # Default configuration for maximum security
```

**Enabling Write Operations:**
```env
# Explicitly enable write operations
GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=false
```

**Unrestricted Write Access:**
```env
# Disable read-only mode to enable write operations
GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=false
# Additional write controls can then be applied as needed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Account Authentication Issues

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify that your service account key file path is correct
- Ensure the service account has been granted access to the specific Google Sheets/Calendars/Docs
- Check that the Google Sheets API, Google Calendar API, Google Drive API, and Google Docs API are enabled in your Google Cloud project

**"Spreadsheet not found"**
- Confirm the spreadsheet ID is correct
- Verify the service account has been shared with the spreadsheet
- Check that the spreadsheet hasn't been deleted or moved

**"Permission denied"**
- Ensure the service account has appropriate permissions
- Verify the required scopes are included in your configuration
- Check that the service account key hasn't expired

#### OAuth2 Authentication Issues

**"OAuth2 authorization required"**
- Run the server once to complete the initial OAuth2 flow
- Check that your browser opens automatically during first setup
- Verify that you've granted all requested permissions

**"OAuth2 client configuration error"**
- Ensure both `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are provided and correct
- Both client ID and client secret are required - verify both values from your Google Cloud Console credentials
- Verify the redirect URI matches: `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback`
- Check that the OAuth2 client is configured for "Desktop application"

**"Token storage error"**
- On macOS: Check Keychain access permissions
- On Windows: Verify Credential Manager is accessible
- On Linux: Ensure Secret Service is available
- Fallback: Check file permissions in `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/`

**"Browser doesn't open automatically"**
- Copy the authorization URL from the console and open manually
- Check if `open` command is available on your system

#### Access Control Issues

**"Operation blocked by access control"**
- Check your access control configuration settings
- Verify that the required service is allowed in `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_WRITE_SERVICES`
- Ensure the specific tool is permitted in `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS`
- Confirm you have explicitly enabled write operations (`GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE=false`) - the server defaults to read-only for security

**"Folder access denied"**
- When `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` is set with `GOOGLE_ALLOW_WRITES_OUTSIDE_FOLDER=false`
- Ensure you're trying to modify files within the allowed folder
- Verify the folder ID is correct and the service account has access to it
- Check that the file you're trying to modify is actually in the specified folder

**"Write operation not permitted"**
- Verify `GOOGLE_READ_ONLY_MODE` is explicitly set to `false` (default is `true` for security)
- Check that the service (sheets, docs, calendar, drive) is included in `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_WRITE_SERVICES`
- Ensure the specific tool name is listed in `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS` if using tool-level restrictions
- Confirm your authentication has the necessary scopes for write operations
- Verify no firewall is blocking localhost connections

**"Refresh token expired"**
- Delete stored tokens and re-authenticate: `rm -rf ~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/`
- Or clear OS keychain entries for "google-workspace-mcp"
- Run the server again to complete new OAuth2 flow

#### "Rate limit exceeded" (HTTP 429)
- The server automatically handles rate limits with exponential backoff
- Consider adjusting `GOOGLE_RETRY_MAX_DELAY` for longer operations
- Monitor retry logs to understand usage patterns
- Consider implementing request batching for high-volume operations

#### Tuning Retry Configuration

**For Development/Testing:**
```env
# Faster retries for development
GOOGLE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=2
GOOGLE_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=500
GOOGLE_RETRY_MAX_DELAY=5000
```

**For Production/High-Volume:**
```env
# More resilient settings for production
GOOGLE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
GOOGLE_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=2000
GOOGLE_RETRY_MAX_DELAY=60000
```
